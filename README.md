<!-- Plugin description -->
Compose Hammer is a modern Jetpack Compose UI builder plugin that implements 59+ Material 3 components or the fancy Material You stuff that you see in all modern Android Native apps.
Android Development with Jetpack Compose was never easier. Compose Hammer is so slick that even Thor’s Mjölnir will get envy!
This toolkit eases Android Development, helping you build modern Material 3 user interfaces with Jetpack Compose effortlessly and in no time.
Need to add a new component to your Android project? Don't worry, you're all set up - with Compose Hammer you can do it with just a few keyboard presses - ⌥ Option + ⤶
Enter on Mac or Alt + Enter on Windows/Linux,  Keyboard arrows ↑ (up) and ↓ (down), slam ⤶ Enter and BOOM - it's already in your function with all the necessary imports added.
Or you can find almost all (the ones that are supported in Jetpack Compose now) Material3 components in a well-organized categories with Light/Dark mode previews in your right side-bar (toolwindow) to see how the component looks in advance and copy the code.
Hate those common code lines with thousands of imports when making “by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }” or “Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(8.dp))”? - We've covered that too. And more! Like Animations, Compose runtime stuff and other goodies that can be totally generated for you!
Your time matters and Compose Hammer knows that. This plugin tries its best to optimize (eliminate) the Compose chores that Android devs do so you can focus on what matters - making money, enjoying your work and building great products!
