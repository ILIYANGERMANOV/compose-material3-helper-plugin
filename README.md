<!-- Plugin description -->
Compose Hammer is **an Android Studio Jetpack Compose Material3 UI builder plugin** 
that supports **59+ Material3 components** and 
**X+ Jetpack Compose code patterns** like 
`remember`, `mutableStateOf`, `LaunchedEffect`s, animations, layouts and more!

**TL;DR;**
- **Preview directly in Android Studio** without building the Material3 (MaterialYou) components
from https://m3.material.io.
- **A copy-paste ready implementation code** including imports for 
the Material3 Jetpack Compose components.
- **A quick action (‚å• Option/Alt + ‚§∂ Enter)** that auto-magically
generates and inserts the code for you with all imports necessarily.
- **Full customization code** for the M3 components, so you can more
easily make them match your design requirements.
- **Relevant links** to the [M3 Spec](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/specs) _(anatomy)_,
[M3 Guidelines](https://m3.material.io/components/buttons/guidelines) _(usage)_, and
the [Official Jetpack Compose docs](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/compose/material3/package-summary.html) _(code)_ 
for all components, so you can quickly find the info that you need.

If you haven't done already, watch the 
[Compose Hammer demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07Yeogvw0wo).
"Better show, than tell!"

In a nutshell, Compose Hammer is so slick that even Thor‚Äôs Mj√∂lnir will get envy.
Our goal is to make Android UI development with **Jetpack Compose - easy, fun and fast.
